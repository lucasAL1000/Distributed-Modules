		Requests to send message m to process q.

	Properties
	----------
	PL1: Reliable delivery:
		If a correct process p sends a message m to a correct
		process q, then q eventually delivers m.
	PL2: No duplication:
		No message is delivered by a process more than once.
	PL3: No creation:
		If some process q delivers a message m with sender p, then m
		was previously sent to q by process p.

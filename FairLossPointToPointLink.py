	Properties
	----------
	FLL1: Fair-loss:
		If a correct process p infinitely often sends a message m to a
		correct process q, then q delivers m an infinite number of times.
	FLL2: Finite duplication:
		If a correct process p sends a message m a finite number
		of times to process q, then m cannot be delivered an infinite number of times by q.
	FLL3: No creation:
		If some process q delivers a message m with sender p, then m
		was previously sent to q by process p.
